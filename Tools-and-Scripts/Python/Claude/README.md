# Claude Variants (Placeholder)

This folder will contain Claude-generated transformations of Jonas’s original Python script.

Files will be added manually after interacting with Claude.

Structure:
- Debugged version in ".py"
- Debugged version (DEBUG NOTES in ".md")
- Blue Team variant in ".py"
- Blue Team variant (DEBUG NOTES in ".md")
- Red Team variant in ".py"
- Blue Team variant (DEBUG NOTES in ".md")

NOTE: Claude was originally asked for 3 files: 1 debug file of Jonás Joya's original code, 1 recontextualization of that code for the blue team, and 1 recontextualization of that code for the red team. However, Claude generated 5 documents; in particular, there was a file generated by Claude called "Debug notes" that was very long, so it had to be split into two files: A) a file entirely in ".py" format and B) a file mainly in ".md" format with internal fragments written in Python.

All scripts will follow the same educational constraints as the Copilot versions.
