# Grok Variants (Placeholder)

This folder will contain Grok-generated transformations of Jonas’s original Python script.

Files will be added manually after interacting with Grok.

Structure:
- Debugged version
- Debugged version (2nd iteration)
- Blue Team variant
- Blue Team variant (2nd iteration)
- Red Team variant
- Red Team variant (2nd iteration)

NOTE: A second iteration by any AI was not originally planned for this project. However, since Grok was the only AI that requested a second iteration (which is appreciated by the project's author, Jonás Joya), it was granted (without the possibility of including the result of this second iteration in the evaluation process in Jonás Joya's future analysis).

All scripts will follow the same educational constraints as the Copilot versions.
