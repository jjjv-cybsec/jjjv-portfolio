# Python Examples for Cybersecurity Learning

This folder contains Python scripts written by **Jonas Joya** and enhanced with the assistance of **Microsoft Copilot**.  
The goal is to demonstrate:
1. Jonas’s ability to write Python code under strict constraints.
2. How Copilot can debug, optimize, and recontextualize code for cybersecurity scenarios.
3. How different AI systems (Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) can produce different transformations of the same base script.

## Learning Objective

Show how a simple algorithmic exercise can evolve into:
- A cleaned and debugged version (Copilot-assisted)
- A Blue Team defensive script
- A Red Team synthetic event generator  
All while respecting strict educational constraints.

---

## Educational Constraints

All scripts in this folder intentionally use only:
- `str`, `int`, `float`
- Variables
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- **No** loops (in some variants)
- **No** imports
- **No** built-in functions like `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`
- **No** external libraries

These constraints are part of the didactic challenge.

## Folder Structure

- `original/fruit_promo_original.py`  
  Original script written by Jonas.

- `copilot/fruit_promo_debugged.py`  
  Copilot-assisted debugging and cleanup.

- `copilot/blue_team_ip_monitor.py`  
  Copilot recontextualization for defensive cybersecurity.

- `copilot/red_team_synthetic_events.py`  
  Copilot recontextualization for synthetic Red Team event generation.

- `DEBUG_NOTES.md`  
  Copilot’s analysis of the debugging process.

---

## Academic Integrity Note

The original script was written by Jonas during coursework.  
All Copilot-generated variants are adaptations that preserve the learning intent while avoiding duplication of course materials.

---

## Future Expansion

This section will later include:
- Gemini versions  
- ChatGPT versions  
- Claude versions  
- Grok versions  

Each in its own folder for comparison.
