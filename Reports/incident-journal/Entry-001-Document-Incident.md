- Maintain and regularly test offline, immutable backups to enable recovery without paying ransom.  
- Ensure incident response playbooks include rapid containment steps, communication templates, and escalation paths to external responders.  
- Implement network segmentation and least-privilege access to reduce blast radius of ransomware.
